Hello! This was my final project that I completed for my AI class (CSCI 4511W at the University of Minnesota).

The purpose of this project was to test if Monte Carlo search would be an effective method of playing the game Quarto. As it turns out, the answer is no. 

I added this repository after the fact, so all the work was committed all at once.
